2. 🎭 Rate your Mood (a way for patients to keep track of how they're feeling and increase their self-awareness)
3. 🖐️ Suggestion (smart suggestions based on how the patient is feeling i.e if it says they are feeling low suggest *watch a video* or *play a game*. If they say they are feeling great then suggest they *speak to family* to make them feel even better).
